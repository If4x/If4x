Hi,
I'm If4x. I'm a self tought student developer for C++ (microcontrollers), Python, PHP, HTML, CSS, JS and SQL.

Over the past 7 years I've spent my time exploring more and more and therefor teaching myself new things everyday. I am searing for new challenges as soon as I achieved a previous one to never stop learning. Where is this journey going to take me next? - I have no idea about that but it will be interesting for sure!

I am starting projects based on own demands or initiative but also inspiration by others. On my github you can find some of those projects.
